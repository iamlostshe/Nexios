# What is Nexios ?

If Express.js and Python had a wild night of coding, the result would be Nexios—a fast, lightweight, no-nonsense framework that lets you build web apps without the headache.

Think of it as Express.js but speaking fluent Python. It doesn’t force you into strict rules, doesn’t ask for long configurations, and definitely doesn’t judge your coding habits. It just works—so you can focus on writing awesome code instead of wrestling with boilerplate.

With Nexios, you’re in charge. Want to structure your app your way? Go for it. Need to slap together a quick API in minutes? Done. It’s all about freedom, speed, and keeping things simple—just like Express, but Pythonic.

No magic. No unnecessary fluff. Just clean, modular, and fun development. Because let’s be honest—who doesn’t love a framework that gets out of the way and lets you ship fast?

### Why Nexios ?

* Lightweight & Fast – No unnecessary bloat, just install and start coding immediately.
* Modular & Flexible – Use what you need, ignore what you don’t. No rigid structures.
* Pythonic & Expressive – Clean, readable, and intuitive, designed to feel natural in Python.

* ORM-Agnostic – Works with SQLAlchemy, Tortoise, Django ORM, or even raw SQL.
