#### Authentication

The authentication system in Nexios is built with modern API security practices in mind. It supports a variety of authentication methods, including JSON Web Tokens (JWT), API keys, and session-based authentication. The system is designed to be fully asynchronous, ensuring that authentication processes do not block your application's performance.

## Basic Configuration

To enable authentication in your API, you need to configure the authentication middleware. This middleware handles the validation of authentication tokens, session management, and user retrieval.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to set up the authentication middleware with JWT:

> Note:  some authentication backend configuration might require `secret_key` , ensure to add secret key to the application configuration


```py


from nexios import get_application
from  nexios.auth.backends import  JWTAuthBackend
from nexios.auth.middleware import AuthenticationMiddleware

app = get_application()

async def validation_funtion(**kwaargs):
    #kwargs is returned from the jwt payload
    #db checks
app.add_middleware(
    AuthenticationMiddleware(
        backend = JWTAuthBackend(authenticate_func = validation_funtion)
    )
)

```


Nexios keeps authentication simple and fast with its fully async system. The code sets up JWT authentication using `AuthenticationMiddleware`, which checks every request for a valid token. It works with `JWTAuthBackend` to decode the JWT and pass its data to a custom validation function. This function runs extra checks, like verifying the user in the database, before allowing access.  

Adding authentication is just one line with `app.add_middleware`, keeping things clean and easy. The validation function is async, so it handles database lookups without slowing things down. Since JWT relies on secure signatures, setting a `SECRET_KEY` in your config is a must. This setup ensures smooth, secure authentication without the hassle.


## Protected Routes

In Nexios, a protected route ensures only authenticated users can access specific endpoints. The `AuthenticationMiddleware` validates the request by running `authenticate_func`. If authentication succeeds, `request.user` is set to whatever `authenticate_func` returns, and `request.scope["auth"]` is set accordingly (e.g., `"jwt"`). If authentication fails, `request.user` is set to an `UnauthenticatedUser`, maintaining consistency while blocking unauthorized access.
